Hello, readers 

Sandeep here from this side 🫡
 

This is my chrome extension which is used to track your time, 
Whether you are doing something productive or just wasting your time

So you can use this easy extension to know about your habits, and how much unproductive times are you using 

leetcode, github, stack overflow etc are considered productive.

And Youtube, Reddit, Insta etc are considered to be unproductive.

You are welcome to add sites and label them as per your usecase. 


Thank you😊❤️
Have a nice and happy day╰(*°▽°*)╯❤️❤️
